            last year I've done videos, tutorials & work in 
            design, Development.</p>
            <p class="bd">I noticed programmers often have difficulty 
                with the design for a website or application.
                Functionality comes first, and designs is left
                in dust.</p>
                <p class="bd">
                    There is no trick to design, its just a number 
                    of rules and guidelines to leran and follow,
                    just like any class or object oriented
